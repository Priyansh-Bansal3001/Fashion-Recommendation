# 👗 Fashion Recommendation System

This is a **Streamlit-based Fashion Recommendation System** that helps users find visually similar fashion products based on a given image. It uses deep learning-generated embeddings and a k-NN similarity model to recommend the most relevant products.

---

## 🚀 Demo

Upload an image, and the system will recommend visually similar items!

> ⚠️ This project is **for local execution**. (Optionally, it can be deployed on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud))

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔍 Content-based image similarity
- 🤖 Precomputed embeddings for fast recommendation
- 🖼️ Upload fashion images (tops, dresses, etc.)
- ⚡ Built with **Streamlit** for a clean UI
- 💡 Lightweight & fast inference (no retraining needed)

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Streamlit
- NumPy, scikit-learn
- Pretrained deep learning model (e.g., ResNet / VGG for embedding generation)
- Git LFS (for storing large `.pkl` embedding files)

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `app.py` – Streamlit app frontend
- `main.py`, `test.py` – Core recommendation logic
- `embeddings.pkl` – Precomputed deep feature vectors (**tracked with Git LFS**)
- `filenames.pkl` – Image file names corresponding to embeddings
- `images/` – Folder with all fashion product images
- `uploads/` – Folder where uploaded user images are temporarily stored
- `sample/` – Sample fashion inputs for testing
- `.gitignore` – Ignores virtual environment, caches, and OS files
- `.gitattributes` – Tracks `.pkl` files with Git LFS
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies

## ✅ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Priyansh-Bansal3001/Fashion-Recommendation.git
   cd Fashion-Recommendation
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the app

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
🧊 Git LFS Note
This repo uses Git Large File Storage to track large files like embeddings.pkl.

If you haven't already:

bash
Copy
Edit
git lfs install
git lfs pull
📌 To-Do / Improvements
 Add filtering by color or clothing type

 Add user feedback loop for better ranking

Let me know if you want me to:
- Add usage screenshots or gifs
- Write installation instructions for **Streamlit Cloud**
- Include model/architecture details in the README

Want this saved directly into a `README.md` file in your project? I can guide you or generate that too.
